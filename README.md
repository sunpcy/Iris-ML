# Iris-ML
**Classification of Iris Species using Machine Learning Algorithms**

**Objective:** Developed a machine learning model to classify Iris species using the Iris dataset, focusing on comparing the performance of different algorithms.

**Dataset:** Utilized the Iris dataset containing 150 samples of Iris flowers, with features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soylevbeytullah/flowers-dataset-iris/data

**Methods:** Implemented and compared the performance of three classification algorithms:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest (RF)

**Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Achieved high accuracy with the KNN model, outperforming others with a weighted average F1-score of 0.96.

**Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

**Key Skills:** Data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, classification, data visualization
